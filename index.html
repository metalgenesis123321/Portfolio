            Hi! I’m Shravan Swami, a Master’s student in Data Science,
            Analytics and Engineering at Arizona State University (GPA 3.67).
            My academic foundation blends core computer science with
            advanced data analysis and includes graduate‑level coursework in
            cloud computing, statistical machine learning, large‑scale data
            processing, data mining, optimisation and machine vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to graduate school I earned a Bachelor of Technology in
            Computer Science and Engineering from Hindustan Institute of
            Technology and Science (GPA 8.51/10, August 2020 – May 2024).
            There I gained a strong grounding in object‑oriented
            programming, database systems, algorithms, operating systems
            and artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside the classroom, I channel my competitive spirit through
            gaming and sports. With more than 5,000 hours of CS:GO under
            my belt, I know a thing or two about strategy and fast
            reflexes. I’m also a dedicated karate practitioner (black
            belt) and captained my school and college soccer teams.
            These experiences taught me discipline, leadership and
            teamwork—qualities I carry into my professional work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognized for my technical skills and dedication, I was
            awarded <strong>Best Intern of the Month</strong> at
            Intellect Design Arena in 2024 after winning a Java coding
            competition for writing highly efficient solutions. I’m
            always eager to take on new challenges and explore
            innovative technologies.

          <h3>Software Developer Intern</h3>
          <h4>Intellect Design Arena – Chennai, India | January 2024 – July 2024</h4>
          <p>
            Developed the backend for a new financial management web
            application designed to replace an older, slower system.
            Enhanced efficiency by optimising APIs and database schemas,
            improving speed by 10 percent without compromising
            reliability. Built scalable modules and optimised RESTful
            APIs, reducing average query latency by 28 percent and
            enabling the application to handle 25 percent more
            concurrent users.

          <p>
            Diagnosed and resolved network connectivity issues by
            analysing packet data and traffic patterns, improving
            stability and reducing downtime by 15 percent. Addressed
            hardware malfunctions through device replacements and
            firmware upgrades while performing routine checks to
            maintain uptime. Collaborated with senior engineers to
            implement security protocols and optimise network
            performance. Executed and validated network configurations
            by running connectivity tests and troubleshooting
            deployment errors, ensuring smooth rollout of more than

          <p>
            Designed a priority‑based aircraft landing system by building a
            custom reinforcement learning environment in Python that
            modelled aircraft states, transitions and action spaces across
            more than 100 realistic traffic conditions. Developed a
            domain‑specific reward function incorporating fuel
            thresholds, emergencies and scheduling urgency, then trained
            an optimised Deep Q‑Network agent that converged to a
            stable policy for adaptive landing prioritisation. Fine‑tuned
            LLaMA 3.2 models with Retrieval‑Augmented Generation to
            provide domain‑specific responses.

          <p>
            Developed a facial recognition tool capable of isolating
            individual identities in group photographs. Implemented
            using Python with TensorFlow and Keras, the model
            leverages ensemble learning to disentangle features and
            accurately identify faces. Deployed on AWS for seamless

            Designed a system that automatically generates radiology
            reports by combining computer vision and natural language
            processing. Utilised transformer models and memory‑driven
            modules to interpret medical images and employed the

          <h3>Hybrid Framework for MRI‑to‑CT Translation</h3>
          <p>
            Built a deep‑learning pipeline that combines latent diffusion
            models, Swin Transformers and Bayesian uncertainty
            quantification (Monte Carlo Dropout, Gaussian Processes,
            Conformal Prediction) to translate MRI scans into synthetic
            CT images. The framework produces anatomically faithful
            outputs with clinically interpretable reliability,
            supporting radiation oncology planning.

            and ReLU activations for univariate time‑series prediction.
            Trained the network with the Adam optimiser and mean
            squared error loss, performed train/validation/test splits
            and achieved a mean squared error of 0.00209, demonstrating
            high forecasting accuracy.
