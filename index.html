          <p>
            Hi! I’m Shravan Swami, a Master’s student in Data Science,
            Analytics and Engineering at Arizona State University (GPA 3.67).
            My academic foundation blends fundamental computer science
            with advanced data analysis, including courses on cloud
            computing, statistical machine learning and large‑scale
            data processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before starting my graduate studies, I completed a Bachelor of
            Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Hindustan
            Institute of Technology and Science (GPA 8.51/10) where I
            learned the fundamentals of object‑oriented programming,
            databases, algorithms and AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside the classroom, I channel my competitive spirit through
            gaming and sports. With more than 5,000 hours of CS:GO under
            my belt, I know a thing or two about strategy and fast
            reflexes. I’m also a dedicated karate practitioner (black
            belt) and captained my school and college soccer teams.
            These experiences taught me discipline, leadership and
            teamwork—qualities I carry into my professional work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognized for my technical skills and dedication, I was
            awarded <strong>Best Intern of the Month</strong> at
            Intellect Design Arena in 2024 after winning a Java coding
            competition for writing highly efficient solutions. I’m
            always eager to take on new challenges and explore
            innovative technologies.
