          <p>Hi! I’m Shravan Swami, a Master’s student in Data Science, Analytics and Engineering at Arizona State University (GPA 3.67). My academic foundation blends fundamental computer science with advanced data analysis, including courses on cloud computing, statistical machine learning and large‑scale data processing.</p>
          <p>Before starting my graduate studies, I completed a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science (GPA 8.51/10) where I learned the fundamentals of object‑oriented programming, databases, algorithms and AI.</p>
          <p>Outside the classroom, I channel my competitive spirit through gaming and sports. With more than 5,000 hours of CS:GO under my belt, I know a thing or two about strategy and fast reflexes. I’m also a dedicated karate practitioner (black belt) and captained my school and college soccer teams. These experiences taught me discipline, leadership and teamwork—qualities I carry into my professional work.</p>
          <p>Recognized for my technical skills and dedication, I was awarded <strong>Best Intern of the Month</strong> at Intellect Design Arena in 2024 after winning a Java coding competition for writing highly efficient solutions. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and explore innovative technologies.</p>
